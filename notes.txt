FIREDRAKE EDITS:
1.
In venv-firedrake\lib\python3.10\site-packages\tsfc\driver.py, lines 100-101

#raise NotImplementedError("Sorry, we can't assemble the diagonal of a form for interior facet integrals") # EDITED BY JF

2. Maybe already done ?
In functionspace.py, TensorFunctionSpace:

if shape is None:
    shape = (mesh.geometric_dimension(),) * 2
