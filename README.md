The user provides the UFL form, a target functional J(u), and a tolerance; the solver estimates the goal error |J(u)-J(u_h)| and refines cells in the mesh that contribute most to this error, iterating until the tolerance is met. For eigenproblems, the user provides a target eigenvalue, and the solver minimises the error in the closest eigenvalue, |λ-λ_h|.

A major barrier to adoption of goal-based adaptivity has been the requirement for error estimators to be manually derived for each PDE problem. Our solver removes the need for manual derivations by automatically computing local error estimators, making goal-based adaptivity accessible to those without specialist expertise (in the dual-weighted residual method, the theory upon which our solver lies).
